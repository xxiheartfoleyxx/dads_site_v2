  <h3>ADVANCE DIRECTIVES / MEDICAL SURROGATES</h3>
<p>
  When it comes to catastrophic health care issues, a little prevention will go a long way to helping resolve some complex legal questions that may arise in the event you are incapacitated.
</p>
<p>
  In Florida, we have all become familiar with the issues that surrounded the Terry Schiavo case, the woman who was trapped in a persistent vegitative medical condition because of the lack of an advance directive.

  <h4>Advance Directives</h4>
<p>
  When you reach a point when you may not be able to make your wishes known, an advance directive, or living will, can let family and loved ones know exactly how to handle your medical affairs. The advance directive becomes effective when two doctors agree a patient is terminal, end-stage or in a persistent vegitative state.
</p>
<p>
  The advance directive, when properly prepared, can be used to help avoid family fights, legal wrangling or even, such as the Schiavo case, political debates that could bring you or loved ones to the center of controversy.
</p>
<p>
  In Florida, and elsewhere, a living will or advance directive is a private matter that should always be handled within the family, and with the guidance of an experienced attorney.

  <h4>Health Care Surrogates / Medical Surrogates</h4>
<p>
  A health care surrogate or medical surrogate is a person that you have chosen to act on your behalf, in the event you are hospitalized and unable to make decisions. The appointment of a health care surrogate is a large responsibility, and it should not be made lightly.
</p>
<p>
  Health care surrogates will authorize or decline surguries, medications, transfers from one hospital to another, and even make decisions about whether to continue life-preserving treatments.
